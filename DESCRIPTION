Description: rstreg provides parametric survival models similar to those implemented in 
    Stata's streg command. Other packages also provide such models, but no one package contains
    all of the features available in the Stata command. For instance, survreg from the survival
    package does not support delayed entry/counting process survival data. On the other hand, phreg from the 
    eha package does allow counting process survival data, but does not allow for weighted/pseudolikelihood
    estimation. This package will support weighted/pseudolikelihood estimation of parametric survival models
    with (possibly) delayed entry.
